# FRT-Project
This website was made by my teammate and me to help the tourists. *The goal of our project is to create a website that assists travellers with planning their trips and accommodation arrangements. *Although there are numerous websites, ours has simple navigation and offers affordable prices. *Booking tickets, communicating, identifying a destination, and lodging are issues that tourists have when they are visiting a new location. *By getting in touch with us via our website, you may solve those issues, and from there, we'll arrange for them to travel and stay in accommodations that suit their requirements. *There won't be a language barrier because we will send guides with them to show the locations and explain the significance of them. *Hopefully, we can assert that our initiative is related to the issue at hand.
